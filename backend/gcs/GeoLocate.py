    - Handles converting bbox information to longitude & latitude

    Parameters:
        uav_longitude - longitude of the center of the image in degrees
        uav_latitude - latitude of the center of the image in degrees
        uav_altitude - altitude of the uav in meters (height above ground)
        bearing - azimuth angle measured from North clockwise in degrees (drone's heading)
        cam_fov - field of view of the camera in degrees (diagonal FOV)
        img_width_px - width of the image in pixels
        img_height_px - height of the image in pixels
        obj_x_px - x coordinate of the target object in pixels where (0,0) is the center of the image
        obj_y_px - y coordinate of the target object in pixels where (0,0) is the center of the image
        
    Returns:
        (obj_longitude, obj_latitude) - the estimated longitude and latitude of the object
        
    How it works:
        1. Calculates ground coverage from camera FOV and altitude
        2. Converts pixel coordinates to real-world meters
        3. Uses geodesic math to account for Earth's curvature
        4. Returns GPS coordinates of the detected object
